		<p>Hello there. Nice to see all you young boys and girls are willing to know more about a simple old lady like me.<br>
		Because that is who I am; with or without powers.</p>
		<p>But the lack of super powers does not stop one from doing their duty to their homeland, does it?<br>
		It definitely does not a stand a chance against your super power.<br>

		<h3>What is your duty?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><u>Walk/Ride a Bike.</u> Sometimes,  walking or riding a bike is a great way to get some exercise and reduce your carbon footprint.</li>
			<li><u>Unplug Unused Electronics.</u> Even unused electronics can suck up energy, so unplug rarely-used items to reduce energy consumption and your electric bill.</li>
			<li><u>Use Public Transportation/Carpool.</u> If walking or riding a bike is out of the question, mass transit and/or carpooling causes less strain on the environment and puts a smaller dent on your bank account.</li>
			<li><u>Install Low-Flow Showerhead.</u> Low-flow showerheads use less water, meaning a lower water bill and less strain on our limited supply of fresh, drinkable water.</li>
			<li><u>Sign Up for E-Billing.</u> It can save you time and save lots of trees.</li>
			<li><u>Change the Thermostat Level.</u> Lowering the thermostat level during cooler temperatures and raising it a few degrees in warmer weather can save you some money and reduce the use of fossil fuels.</li>
			<li><u>Use Reusable Shopping Bags.</u> Plastic bags are not biodegradable, and they often end up ravaging animal habitats or polluting waterways. Instead, use a cloth or canvas bag when doing your grocery shopping.</li>
			<li><u>Bundle Your Errands.</u> If you have several errands to run over the course of a month, try to do them all at one time to save you money and help the environment.</li>
			<li><u>Use compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs.</u> CFLs are more energy efficient than regular incandescent bulbs. Although they may be a tad more costly, they use 75% less energy than regular light bulbs and last 6 times longer.</li>
			<li><u>Vote.</u> In a country where citizens elect their representatives, you need individuals who have your best interests at heart. Because the state of the environment affects everybody on Earth, we need politicians who are passionate about protecting the planet.</li>
